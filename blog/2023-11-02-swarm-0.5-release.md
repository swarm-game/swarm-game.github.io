The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) development team is
pleased to announce the latest (alpha) release of the game.

Much work since the last release has gone into making Swarm even
more contributor friendly, spanning CI, better Haddock coverage,
and JSON schemas.

A few of the most significant new features are highlighted below; for
full details, see the [release
notes](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/releases/tag/0.5.0.0). If
you just want to try it out, see the [installation
instructions][install].

## What is it?

As a reminder, Swarm is a 2D, open-world programming and resource
gathering game with a strongly-typed, functional programming language
and a unique upgrade system.

## Scenario authoring improvements

Swarm can be played in an "open-world" mode or with
self-contained "scenarios" as stand-alone challenges.

The JSON schema that describes scenario files has been
revamped and also now serves as the authoritative source
of human-readable documentation,
[rendered to markdown](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/data/scenarios/doc-fragments/SCHEMA.md) ([#1441](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1441)).

All scenarios are verified against the schema as part of CI
([#1475](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1475)),
and the schema itself has an enforced structure, e.g.
requiring `"additionalProperties": false` for all `object`s.

All this together means that [online documentation](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/data/scenarios/README.md) stays up-to-date, and authors get hover-documentation and
instant feedback about misspelled or misplaced fields in their
scenario files. Setting up VS Code for this is now ([#1478](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1478)) merely a matter
of installing an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

## Code quality

- Partial functions are now restricted via `hlint` ([#1503](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1503)).
- Huge records are decomposed ([#1510](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1510))
- Richer internal API types ([#1604](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1604))
- Haddocks, wiki, and README improvements (e.g. [#1512](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1512), [#1527](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1527), [#1529](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1529), [#1493](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1493), [#1488](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1488), [#1472](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1472))

- New language features like [recursive types][rectypes],
  [arrays][arrays], [inter-robot communication][robot-comm], and [a
  proper `import` construct][import]
