title: "Swarm alpha release!"
author: "Brent Yorgey"

The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) development team is
very proud to announce the very first alpha release of the game.
There are still many missing features (for example, [saving games is
not yet possible](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/50)) and
[known
bugs](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug+),
but at this point it's quite playable (and, dare we say, fun!) and
ready for some intrepid souls to try it out and give us some feedback.

What is it?
-----------

Swarm is a 2D, open-world programming and resource gathering game with
a strongly-typed, functional programming language and a unique upgrade
system. Unlocking language features is tied to collecting resources,
making it an interesting challenge to bootstrap your way into the use
of the full language.

Notable changes since the [last progress
update](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2022/06/20/swarm-status-report/)
include:

- An all-new in-game tutorial consisting of a sequence of guided challenges
- Several new challenge scenarios (mazes! towers of hanoi!), and
  documentation on how to make your own
- Lots more in-game help and info, including help on currently available
  commands + recipes, and a dialog showing all live robots
- Many more entities, recipes, and language features to explore and collect
- Better mouse support
- Backwards incremental search and tab completion in the REPL
- Many, many small bug fixes and improvements!

- New language features like [recursive types][rectypes],
  [arrays][arrays], [inter-robot communication][robot-comm], and [a
  proper `import` construct][import]
