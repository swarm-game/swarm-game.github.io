The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) development team is
pleased to announce the latest (alpha) release of the game.

It's been quite a while since our last release, so this one includes
a lot.  Some of the biggest highlights include native Windows support,
customizable keybindings, type synonyms and equirecursive types, and a
prototype tournament server
([#1798](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1798)) where players
can upload their solutions to challenge scenarios.

We also have a [new Discord server][discord]---come say hi!

Read on for a more in-depth discussion of some of the new features, or
see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or even the [complete list of git
commits](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/commits/main/?since=2023-11-01&until=2024-06-23).

## What is it?

As a reminder, Swarm is a 2D, open-world programming and resource
gathering game with a strongly-typed, functional programming language
and a unique upgrade system.

## Language improvements

In terms of the Swarm programming language, this release has a few big
new features, adds a few more primitive commands, and fixes one embarrassing bug.

New primitive commands include `volume` (for measuring enclosed
areas) and `sow` (for planting things that grow and spread). In
addition, quite a few primitive commands that were previously only available
to system robots or in creative mode now have corresponding craftable
entities (*e.g.* `selfdestruct` via `detonator`; `teleport` via `infinite
improbability drive`; `push` via `dozer blade`; *etc.*)

The big new features are *type synonyms* and *(equi-)recursive types*.
For example, you can now define a type of lists like so:

```
tydef List a = rec l. Unit + a * l end

def length : List a -> Int = \xs.
  case xs
    (\_. 0)
    (\c. 1 + length (snd c))
end
```

Finally, an embarrassing [bug where variable names sometimes shadowed
things in outer
scopes](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/681) has been fixed
via a [massive refactoring that ended up closing a total of *ten*
issues all at once](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/1928).
