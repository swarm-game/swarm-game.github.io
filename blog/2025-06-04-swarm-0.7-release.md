The [Swarm](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/) [development team][contributors] is
pleased to announce the latest alpha release of the game.

[contributors]: https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors

It's been quite a while since our last release, and the pace of
development has been slower this year---but development continues nonetheless!

Read on for a more in-depth discussion of some of the new features, or
see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or even the [complete list of git
commits](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/commits/main/?since=2024-07-14&until=2025-06-04).

## What is it?

As a reminder, Swarm is a 2D, open-world programming and resource
gathering game with a strongly-typed, functional programming language
and a unique upgrade system.

## ZuriHac!

Several of us will be at [ZuriHac](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2025/) in person.  If
you're at ZuriHac in person too, come say hi, try out the game, and maybe
hack on some [low-hanging fruit][low-hanging]!

If you won't be at ZuriHac in person but still want to try hacking on
Swarm, come join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kp8MuSgkPw) or [The Swarm Hive on Gather.town](https://app.gather.town/app/SpqG1ic5pNKM7YqS/The%20Swarm%20Hive)!

## New challenge scenarios

There are a number of new challenge scenarios included in this
release, with example screenshots shown below.

## Tutorial improvements

There have been a bunch of improvements to the in-game tutorial: from
small things like making sure choosing `Tutorial` from the menu
automatically takes you to the first *unsolved* tutorial level, to big
things like level redesigns and prose rewrites.

## Language improvements

The Swarm language itself hasn't changed too much in this release. `return`
has been renamed to `pure`
([#2285](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/2285)), and we have
retired `fst` and `snd` in favor of a pair elimination form called `match`
([#2407](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/2407)).  As usual,
you can automatically convert 0.6 code to 0.7 with `swarm format --v0.6`.

There are also a few new commands:

- The `print` and `erase` commands allow printing values on `paper` ([#2245](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/2245)).
- There is also a new `read` command, which can parse values from
  their textual representations ([#2224](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/pull/2224)).

## Other enhancements

There were a ton of other small improvements, like fixing several
space leaks, adding some achievements, adding a few hints to classic
mode, adding a feature to render contiguous walls, and a number of
small UI tweaks.
