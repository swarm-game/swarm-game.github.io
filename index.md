Swarm is a terminal-based 2D programming and resource gathering
game. Program your robots to explore the world and collect resources,
which in turn allows you to build upgraded robots that can run more
interesting and complex programs.  Check out the [installation
instructions](/installing), join the [IRC
channel](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/COMMUNITY.md),
take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki),

Features include:

* Practically infinite 2D procedurally generated worlds
* Simple yet powerful statically typed programming language based on
  the polymorphic lambda calculus + recursion, with a command monad
  for describing first-class imperative actions
* Editor support with syntax and error highlighting via LSP
* In-game tutorial
* A classic open-world mode, in which you start with the ability to
  produce only very basic, limited robots; collecting resources allows
  you to bootstrap your way into programming more sophisticated robots
  that can explore more of the world, set up automated production
  pipelines, and unlock additional language features.
* A large collection of standalone scenarios, challenging you to use
  your ingenuity and programming skill to complete specific tasks
  using only the given resources or language features.
