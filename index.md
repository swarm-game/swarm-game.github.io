Swarm is a 2D programming and resource gathering game. Program your
robots to explore the world and collect resources, which in turn
allows you to build upgraded robots that can run more interesting and
complex programs.  Check out the [installation
instructions](/installing), join the [IRC
channel](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/blob/main/COMMUNITY.md),
take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/wiki),

Features include:

* Practically infinite 2D procedurally generated worlds
* Simple yet powerful programming language based on the polymorphic
  lambda calculus + recursion, with a command monad for describing
  first-class imperative actions
* Editor support with LSP and highlighting
* In-game tutorial
* Multiple game modes:
    - In Classic mode, you start with the ability to produce only very
      basic, limited robots; collecting resources allows you to
      bootstrap your way into programming more sophisticated robots
      that can explore more of the world, collect more resources, etc.
    - Creative mode places no restrictions: program robots to your
      heart's content using whatever language features you want,
      without worrying about collecting resources.
    - There are also challenge scenarios where you attempt to program
      robots in order to solve pre-designed puzzles or challenges.
